As the cat
climbed over
the top of

first the right

carefully
then the hind
stepped down

into the round
of the empty
flowerpot.

  <blockquote cite="https://www.purrfectpost.com/top-10-reasons-cats-are-awesome/">
    Cats are hilarious. Really. Just ask the internet. They do the cutest,
    sweetest things you can imagine, and they can really lower
    their humans' stress levels. Nothing beats coming home after a challenging day
    and watching your cat romp around after his toys, acting like a clown.
  </blockquote>
